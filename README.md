# Frontend Test Rokk3rlabs

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rokk3rlabs/frontend-test/master/logo.png)

This is the official Rokk3rlabs frontend test.

## Getting Started
`git clone https://github.com/edgarflorez/rokk3rlabs && cd rokk3rlabs && npm install`

## Development 
On the folder rokk3rlabs run the gulp command
`$ gulp`

## Production Files
- All the production files are in the folder rokk3rlabs/public. `NOTE` those files should be run on a server environment, In this case I used MAMP.
- `open news.html`
- `open dashboard.html`

## Deadline

The estimated time for this test is four (4) hours, but I spent about 6 hours.

## Progress
- I created the setup for development, Gulp, Sass and Javascript
- Implement only one chat, `the doughnut chart` with static data from the json `activity-data.json`. In this case implement `chartjs`
- Markup HTML and CSS of the two sections `news.html` and `dashboard.html`
- I couldn't complete the other charts and the main task `update the charts each minute`



> Good luck and enjoy!
